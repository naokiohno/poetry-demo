# Poetry Demo

A demo project repository. The Python interpreter version and the exact version of package dependencies are fixed. After cloning the repository, a local virtual environment can be created with the appropriate dependencies automatically installed. This ensures everyone contributing to the project works on an identical environment, and that the scripts can be run even after the maintenance of the project is discontinued.

This is an alternative to using a requirements.txt file with pip.
